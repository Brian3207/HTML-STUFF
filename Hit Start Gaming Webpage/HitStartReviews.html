            <p>Alright, let's talk about Days Gone. But first here's what we are getting into..
            
            Days Gone is an action-adventure game developed by SIE Bend Studio and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment for PlayStation 4 on April 26, 2019.
            
            Set in a post-apocalyptic Oregon two years after a global pandemic, former outlaw-turned-drifter Deacon St. John discovers the possibility 
            
            of his wife Sarah still being alive, which leads Deacon on a quest to find her?
            
            Days Gone is played from a third-person perspective, in which the player can explore an open world environment.
            
            Players can use firearms,melee weapons and improvised weapons, and can use stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures known as Freakers.
            
            A major game mechanic is Deacon's drifter bike, which is used as the player's primary mode of transportation as well as mobile inventory.</p>

            <b><h2< style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0);"><font size="4"<font face="Gobsmacked Demo"><u><b>Gameplay</u></b></font></h2></b><br></br>
            
            <p>Minus the once in a while bugs and game breaking glitches, this game is a lot of FUN!! The combat aspect is smooth and it is easy to transition between weapons. 
            
            The crafting is easy. Bend Studio really made this quick and simple. It allows you to do what you want and not lose sight of playing the game.</p>

            
<!---GRAPHICS AND PERFORMANCE-->
            
            <b><h2< style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0);"><font size="4"<font face="Gobsmacked Demo"><u><b>Graphics and Performance</u></b></font></h2></b><br></br> <p> Minus the once in a while sluggish transition and game breaking glitches the only real complaint is... the LOADING time between cut scenes and gameplay.
            
            It's horrendous. There is a lot to the game but waiting 45 seconds to 1 minute to jump back in seems a bit long and it can become rather annoying. If only this can be adjusted.</p>
            
            
<!--MUSIC AND SOUND-->
            
            <b><h2< style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0);"><font size="4"<font face="Gobsmacked Demo">
            
            <u><b>Music and Sounds</u></b></font></h2></b><br></br> The music and sounds accomplish what it has set out to do. It sets up moments of intensity and sorrow. 
            
            My biggest compliment is the moments when fellow survivors sit around camp playing original songs.
            
            It really sets up the overall atmosphere of what a true zombie apocalypse would be like... Sad and depressing. Plain and Simple..</p>

                <p> It keeps in on the edge of your seat...but... it can come across predictable.
                    
                        It's a true zombie plot but there are aspects that make it original. SO, just know you aren't going to get something truly ground breaking.</p>
            
                <b><h2< style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0);"><font size="4"<font face="Gobsmacked Demo"><u><b>Replayability</u></b></font></h2></b>
                
                <p>Yes. There is so much to do outside the main story. Each camp you encounter has a story and a set of missions. It will keep you busy and enjoying the game. But, it has the potential to become repetitive.
            
                That's where DLC's and bonus content helps. Bend will have to keep players intrigued.</p>
            
            <b><h2< style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0);"><font size="4"<font face="Gobsmacked Demo"><u><b>Final Thoughts</u></b></font></h2></b>
            
            <p>7.5 out of 10. The load times are rather frustrating, the predictable story moments and the chance for repetitive gameplay can affect the overall enjoyment of the game play through. But with that said, give the game a chance.
            
            It is worth playing!! I am enjoying it and can't wait to see what Bend will provide to players!!

            <p>September 13th. It's almost here. What's specific about September 13th? That's easy... Borderlands 3.  But since the official announcement earlier in 2019, I was experiencing a dry spell of gaming. There wasn't anything out that just caught my attention. So, I went my into my collection and found a gem. I beat Spider-Man 4 days after it's release and decided to wait for its DLC content. But, I got involved in another game and just forgot about it. So I decided to replay this gem and its bonus content. Let's see what I thought.</p> 

<!---SIDE NOTE-->
            
            <b><h2< style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"></h2><font size="4"<font face="Gobsmacked Demo" color="red"><u><b>Side Note</u></b></font></h2></b><br></br>  Episode 6, We all sat down and reviewed Spider-Man. Here were my previous thoughts.
            
            ( I really appreciated the character development throughout the game.  I wasn't a fan of the Mary Jane (M.J) missions placed through out the game..DLC's included. I was disappointed that Mysterio wasn't mentioned nor was placed in the game as a baddie. This was a personal complaint but didn't affect my overall opinion. Overall, I gave it a 9 out of 10. )</p>

Based on the Marvel Comics superhero Spider-Man, it is inspired by the long-running comic book mythology and adaptations in other media. In the main storyline, the super-human crime lord Mr. Negative orchestrates a plot to seize control of New York City's criminal underworld. When Mr. Negative threatens to release a deadly virus, Spider-Man must confront him and protect the city while dealing with the personal problems of his civilian persona, Peter Parker.<br></br>
<!---GAMEPLAY-->
                    <b><h2< style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0);"></h2><font size="4"<font face="Gobsmacked Demo"><u><b>Gameplay</u></b></font></h2></b><br></br> The gameplay was Spectacular. It had the nostalgia factor of the Arkham Series due to the smooth fighting style and combat. So good. The swinging from building from building was also so buttery smooth. it felt natural. You could seriously just swing from building to building and lose track of what was going on during the actual game.<br></br>

There are the occasional glitches but it's expected in any game. None of these glitches were gamebreaking. If anything, it added humor to an already great game.<br></br>

With the addition of the DLC's, it added so much more to the game. It added more to an already great story and added more fun to the side missions. Not to mention, the suits. The suits you can unlock in this game.. blows my mind. Still trying to figure out where some of these alternate outfits came from..
